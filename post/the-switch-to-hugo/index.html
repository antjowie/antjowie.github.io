        <p>I used to have another portfolio site I made in preparation to enter the course <a href="https://www.nhtv.nl/bachelors/creative-media-and-game-technologies/introduction.html">Creative Media and Game Technologies</a> at <a href="https://www.nhtv.nl/">NHTV</a>. <code>(I actually got a place in the course, read more about it [Have yet to import]())</code>. By doing so I hoped to increase my chances during the conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NHTV will be renamed to Breda University of Applied Sciences as of September 2018</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t have any prior knowledge of web development. So I started doing research. I always wondered how the web worked.
</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="lets-host-a-site">Lets host a site</h1>

<h2 id="how-did-my-first-portfolio-come-to-life">How did my first portfolio come to life</h2>

<p>After a while, I stumbled upon the idea of self-hosting. It seemed like the best solution because my site would be small and it didn&rsquo;t have to be hosted at all the time, only when I would have my conversation. <code>(terrible thing is, I actually forgot to show my portfolio during the conversation)</code>. And of course, it&rsquo;s free. So how did I self-host my site?</p>

<h2 id="self-hosting-ain-t-that-hard">Self-hosting ain&rsquo;t that hard</h2>

<p>Well, it really depends on how you approach it. I want to know everything about it, and while that usually is a good mentality, it can also be a pitfall. Web development is not as simple as learning a language. It is a whole other system of what I&rsquo;m used to (maybe another subject sound better).<br />
While I kinda started to understand how to host a site after a while, I was quite afraid of the dangers. You hear it a lot lately. Following steps is easy, but I didn&rsquo;t know the consequences. I didn&rsquo;t know the dangers of opening <code>port 80</code>. In the end, I still did it. I kinda gave up on the whole building a web server myself thing and started looking around what other people did. I surely can&rsquo;t be the only one with this problem.</p>

<p>It was then that I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WAMP</a> which stands for <code>Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP</code>. It basically packages all these things into one executable. <strong>Very</strong> simple. And I started using it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wamp">What is WAMP</h2>

<p>After running <code>WAMP</code>, getting the site up and running was as easy as opening a port, binding the address to my IP address. Because I don&rsquo;t want to remember my IP address every time, I needed a domain. I used the site <a href="https://www.noip.com/">noip</a> for that because it was free and the subdomain was quite easy to remember (my old site was hosted at <a href="http://angelorettob.ddns.net/">http://angelorettob.ddns.net/</a>).</p>

<p>I only have to create the site now. With <code>WAMP</code>, it is easy to do because there is a folder in which your site sits. So all I needed to do was write the <code>HTML</code> for it. I didn&rsquo;t know <code>HTML</code> though. So how do I get a site up and running without any web development knowledge? Well, with <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress(.org)</a> it seemed.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="let-s-make-a-site">Let&rsquo;s make a site</h1>

<h2 id="why-wordpress">Why WordPress</h2>

<p>It seemed that <code>WordPress</code> was a very popular tool used to create websites. <code>(I actually first found out about WordPress. Reading about WordPress led me to WAMP)</code>. So I wanted to use it. I didn&rsquo;t see myself creating themes and layouts for websites at the moment. But I did want a site where I could write all about my projects. So <code>WordPress</code> it is</p>

<p>The site was finally up and running. Well, not that it was a hard thing to do. But it required me to do a lot of copy and pasting, something which I really dislike. I had other priorities though and the site needed to be hosted as soon as possible.<br />
So why scrap it? I finally had my site running, and then I just dropped it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-my-problem-with-wordpress">What is my problem with WordPress</h2>

<p>I gotta be honest, <code>WordPress</code> is great. It is very easy to get your site up and running with it. There is a large, <strong>large</strong> supply of themes which you can choose from. Everything is done for you, all you have to do is choose the right things and start writing content.</p>

<p>This may be great for many people who want to build a site. But it goes against what I want. I want to understand what is happening behind the screens and with <code>WordPress</code> I never really felt in control. My site was bloated with things I didn&rsquo;t need. And every time there was an error, I had to hope I wasn&rsquo;t the only one on the suffering end.<br />
I soon grew tired of the magic <code>WordPress</code> had to offer. I didn&rsquo;t like just writing content for my site, relying on the most popular plugins. It didn&rsquo;t take long until I just dropped the whole site altogether. <code>WordPress</code> is beautiful in that it does everything for you, but I want that control.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="so-how-will-i-host-my-portfolio">So how will I host my portfolio</h1>

<h2 id="let-s-fix-that">Let&rsquo;s fix that</h2>

<p>As a programmer or somebody who just uses the computer extensively, I still felt the urge to have some kind of online portfolio. The earlier the better right. But I couldn&rsquo;t find the interest in going back to my <code>WordPress</code> site.</p>

<p>This all changed when I started to try out <code>Python</code>. I was busy with my engine [Axios (link to be implemented)]() and searched for a bit of information in my book <a href="http://gameenginebook.com/">Game Engine Architecture</a>. The objects in my engine are component based, almost the same as in <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. I was reading about it around the last chapter. I read that some engines use a scripting language to model the components of the objects. Even <code>Python</code> was used. I always had my eye on <code>Python</code>. Not only because it is a <a href="https://stackify.com/popular-programming-languages-2018/">very famous language</a> but also because people seemed to really like their <code>Python</code>.  It does everything for them and everything just makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The popularity of Python has risen steadily over the past 15 years, finally breaking the top 5 on the Tiobe Index a few years ago. This is because Python is a major language in some of most exciting technologies today. Machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Robotics all rely heavily on Python (Robotics also relies on C for its use in systems programming). Cyber Security, one of the top software challenges of our time, is also driven by Python.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="a-little-bit-of-python">A little bit of Python</h2>

<p>If it really is that famous why not learn it? I started reading about this <strong>wonderful</strong> <code>Python</code> everybody seems to love and I can only say that I have fallen in love with it too. <code>C++</code> is the first language that I have started reading seriously, and while I love the power <code>C++</code> gives you, <code>Python</code> just understands what you want to do. I can&rsquo;t really say much about it because I only have written in <code>Python</code> for a bit. But it makes tasks so much <strong>simpler</strong>. Although talking about my <code>Python</code> experiences is a bit beyond this scope.</p>

<p>So what role does <code>Python</code> play in this? During the time that I was reading about <code>Python</code> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5">Corey Schafer</a>, a Youtube channel with programming tutorials (I watched his git tutorial and quite liked it) uploaded a tutorial about <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, A microframework for <code>Python</code> used for web development. <code>(I really have to tone down with the commas)</code>. Naturally, I was interested in this. <code>Python</code> was a very fun language to program in and in combination with <code>Flask</code> hosting a website seemed like fun. So I started to watch his tutorials.</p>

<p>I soon realized that I needed to understand the basics of web development for it. But that was alright, I wanted to understand web development either way. So I started reading everything on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and <a href="http://htmldog.com/">HTML Dog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-real-taste-of-web-development">My first real taste of web development</h2>

<p>I finally understood how a web page worked. What the relation between <code>HTML, CSS and JS</code> files are. It wasn&rsquo;t hard, but it was something that I needed to understand someday, at least the basics of it. So why didn&rsquo;t I go back to <code>Flask</code>?</p>

<p>Well, usually when I&rsquo;m about to sleep, I watch a Youtube video about programming. It&rsquo;s probably not that smart to learn before sleeping but I enjoy it. Because of autoplay, I stumbled upon this video about <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.<br />
Github Pages seemed like the perfect solution. It offered to host my site directly from my repository, and I already use Github either way and I get my own domain. Everything sounds perfect, right?</p>

<p>I started reading the documentation and read about <code>Jekyll</code>. Of course, I started reading the documentation of <code>Jekyll</code> and noticed something I really didn&rsquo;t like.<br />
<code>Jekyll</code> needed <code>Ruby</code> and I had just about enough of learning new things. While I did not need any understanding of <code>Ruby</code> for <code>Jekyll</code>, I forced myself to do understand everything that is happening. It wasn&rsquo;t that hard, but surely there has to be a better way.</p>

<p>That is how I met <code>Hugo</code>.</p>

<h2 id="hello-hugo">Hello Hugo</h2>

<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s talk about <code>Hugo</code>. <code>Hugo</code> is a static site generator just like <code>Jekyll</code> but it is built upon <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, an open-source programming language made by Google. <code>Go</code> is known for being very fast (I think it is based upon multithreading) and <code>Hugo</code> sure is fast. It is way faster than <code>Jekyll</code>. <code>Hugo</code> also didn&rsquo;t need much work to be set up, just download the executable and add it to your PATH.</p>

<p>So why did I choose <code>Hugo</code>? The workflow isn&rsquo;t that different from each other, both use markdown files and build the site with a simple command. It really comes down to preference. I prefer <code>Hugo</code> because the setup is simple and the workflow is straightforward. I don&rsquo;t really like plugins because I want to do the work myself (although I did install a theme). Both would be a good choice, <code>Hugo</code> is just faster and a bit more straightforward.<br />
But I can&rsquo;t really compare the two because I&rsquo;ve only used <code>Hugo</code>.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s how I met <code>Hugo</code>, quite a grand story now that I&rsquo;ve read it myself. My next blog posts won&rsquo;t be this long. I kinda got ahead of myself.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, I&rsquo;m having a great time with <code>Hugo</code> and if you feel like trying it out, you should because it is very easy.</p>
