> Glad to know that you are interested in me as a person! A little thing before you start reading though.  
Down here is a short description of who I am and what I can do. Further down is a small story of how I became who I am at the moment of writing this.

## Who am I 
So who am I? I'm a boy who has been fascinated by technology ever since... I can't actually remember, it has already been so long.  
While I may have forgotten what started my passion for technology. I sure do know what is keeping it alive. The whole society we are living in revolves around technology. Some people take it for granted, but I want to understand everything about it. 

## My skills
I mainly program in `C++` to develop my games but have recently branched out towards `Python` (which I am really liking, it just makes much more sense). My first intention was to learn `Java` to make a Minecraft mod and I'm still planning to do so one day.  
So for a basic list.  

Programming languages:

* C++
* Python

That is all I've got at the moment regarding programming. The list is quite small, but I rather want to understand a language thoroughly instead of skimming over eveerything and not really knowing what to do. In the end, your knowledge of different programming languages are not as important as your skills in problem solving. 

> That concludes the short introduction. Down here follows a section about how I became who I am today, or at the moment of writing this page.

## Why programming
Computers, technology, it's all around us. It's something I want to understand. So what better way to understand then to build it yourself. That is how my passion for programming grew. Programming is a way of communicating with your technology. You're basically telling it what to do. And just like how we people communicate, talking is the best way to understand each other. _`Well, that's not really relevant for a computer but it came up in my head just now`_.  

Another reason why I want to program is because I want to make games. I keep it simple. I've been playing games from a young age and they have played (and are still playing) a huge part in my life. The lessons and experiences that I have learned from games are invaluable to me. I too, want to give people what I have received from games. A simple motive, but life doesn't always have to be complicated. **KISS** `(Keep It Simple, Stupid)`.

## How I got to know programming
I was around twelve years old when I received my first computer. It took me quite a while to get around using the computer. I didn't know my way around the web and I spent most of my times away on small flash games.

After a year or a half did I finally started to understand how to navigate around the web. It was around that time when I discovered [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/ "Yep this game"). I don't have to explain what it is. After I forcefully begged my parents to buy it I could finally play the game and boy did I **love it.** 

My love for the game finally settled down after half a year and I started to play the game a _bit_ less. It was around that time that my friend told me about this modpack. This is a crucial moment because it is when I started to get to know programming.

## The journey to programming
I wanted to make my own mod. And because Minecraft was such a popular game, there were lots of tutorials for it. I started skimming youtube tutorials, installing all kinds of software. Hoping that I could just make one mod where I could turn a block of dirt into a diamond. Sadly enough, I didn't really got far. I just didn't know where to start. `(As a thirteen-year-old, I had quite a hard time knowing how to educate myself on a certain subject. A vital skill for programming)`.

I have made several attempts over the past few years to finally get a grasp on programming. But it never really clicked. It was until I turned sixteen, that I tried a new approach. I tried to break the problem down. And by doing that I started to understand what I always couldn't  
I tried something which was the best decision of my life. **`I started to read`.** I started reading tutorials on the internet. I started reading other peoples experiences. By doing so, I finally could grasp onto something. I finally had a foundation to work on.

## How I finally started learning to program
After I started reading, I became unstoppable. Everything started to make sense, I'd spend my whole days after school just reading, reading the tutorials. Following the exercises. If I didn't understand something, I'd search it up and read about it. All those years of trying started to make sense. But the most surprising change out of all was the way I had always thought about programming. I always thought that programming required this crazy memory because I always saw people just writing random lines. But when I started to finally understand those lines. My world changed forever. The moment that I realized that everything is just text, blew my mind. I never knew that you could open **everything** in a text editor `(of course, a readable output isn't always the case)`.

## So what will I do now
I'm impressed you've made it this far. I've been rambling quite a while now. I'm almost listing my whole experience regarding just reading. Although this is a section about me. Content like this should be kept for blog posts. So let's keep it a bit short.  
My goal in life is to understand technology and play a part in its development. I love the way computers work and want to know everything about them. I'm crazy about games and programs and want to know how to make and improve them. I just love the age we're living in and I want to take full advantage of what it has to offer. I hope to grow into a programmer who can push all the limits on technology. How will I achieve that? I'll keep that a surprise.

Thank you for reading, any questions can be asked via `angelo05rettob@gmail.com`. Maybe I'll start using social media someday. That would make it a lot easier to talk, wouldn't it?
